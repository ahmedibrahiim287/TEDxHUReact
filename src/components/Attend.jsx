          TED is a non profit organization devoted to Ideas worth Spreading. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, 
          Entertainment and Design. Since then its scope has become ever broader. Along with two annual conferences 
          - the TED Conference in Long Beach and Palm Springs each spring, and the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh UK each summer - 
          TED includes the award-winning TEDTalks video site, the Open Translation Project and TED Conversations, 
          the inspiring TED Fellows and TEDx programs, and the annual TED Prize.
